# jecklist

Jecklist is a sharing to do list app, but different. Instead of juggling multiple lists people have shared with you, Jecklist makes it easy so that everyone can share a single list. With a checkbox for every person next to each task, you can easily see who has or hasn't completed a task. This can encourage accountability and motivation to complete every task on the list. Jecklist also lets you know the percentage of how much you've completed an entire list. Simple and easy to use, we created Jecklist to maximize productivity by keeping yourself and others on track.
